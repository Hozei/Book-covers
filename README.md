# Book Covers
This is a Book cover project that i did on my own, 
that shares different types of books that I've read.

## stacks used on this project:

* Express
* Node.js
* PostgreSQL
* EJS

## The important part of this project for me is:
Using _API's_ to pass book data into our _EJS_ file to be rendered.


The book covers used are obtained from https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers

## To Run the project:

npm i

run __nodemon:__ nodemon index.js

view the project on _localhost:3000_
